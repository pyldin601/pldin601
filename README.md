### Hi there 👋

🔭 I am a software engineer who enjoys developing web applications and working with multimedia, particularly audio and video streaming and processing services.

🌱 I'm always excited to learn new programming languages and technologies, especially when they're needed for a project.

👯  I'm interested in collaborating on software projects that involve full-stack development, with a particular focus on backends and multimedia services.

🌟 I believe that being open-minded and willing to learn is key to being a successful engineer.

⚡ Fun fact: One line of my code caused a colleague to leave the company, but another line of my code helped resolve a rare, long-standing issue that users had been struggling with for years.
