### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ I am a software engineer who enjoys developing web applications and working with multimedia, particularly audio and video streaming and processing services.

ðŸŒ± I'm always excited to learn new programming languages and technologies, especially when they're needed for a project.

ðŸ‘¯ I am interested in collaborating on projects that involve backend development or multimedia services.

ðŸŒŸ I believe that being open-minded and willing to learn is key to being a successful engineer.

âš¡ Fun fact: One line of my code caused a colleague to leave the company, but another line of my code helped resolve a rare, long-standing issue that users had been struggling with for years.
